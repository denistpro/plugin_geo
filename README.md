plugin for creating new post type and using google maps api
===========================================================

This plugin is written for WordPress.
This plugin uses API Google Maps.
This plugin creates a custom post type called "Experts" with a custom field to enter the expert's address.
After that, this plugin creates the [expertsmap] shortcode to display a table of experts and a google map with expert markers corresponding to the addresses.
If there are no custom posts, then the shortcode displays several example experts with addresses.
See the link for an example of how the plugin works:
The project is in working condition, but some changes can be made until 09/26/2022
